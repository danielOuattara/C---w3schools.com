/* C++ Access Specifiers
==========================

By now, you are quite familiar with the 'public' keyword
that appears in all of our class examples: */

// class MyClass
// {       // The class
// public: // Access specifier
//         // class members goes here
// };

/*
The public keyword is an access specifier.
Access specifiers define how the members i.e attributes
and methods of a class can be accessed.

In the example above, the members are public - which means
that they can be accessed and modified from outside the code.

However, what if we want members to be private and hidden
from the outside world ?

In C++, there are three access specifiers:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
> public - members are accessible from outside the class
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
> private - members cannot be accessed/viewed from outside the class
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
> protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class,
              however, they can be accessed in inherited classes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

class MyClass
{
public:
    int x;

private:
    int y;
};

int main()
{
    MyClass myObj;
    myObj.x = 25; // Allowed (public)
    // myObj.y = 50; // Not allowed (private)
    return 0;
}

/* If you try to access a private member, an error occurs:
error: y is private

Note: It is possible to access private members of a class
      using a public method inside the same class.
      See the Encapsulation chapter on how to do this.

Tip: It is considered good practice to declare your class
     attributes as private as often as you can .
     This will reduce the possibility of yourself or others
     to mess up the code. This is also the main ingredient
     of the Encapsulation concept, which you will learn more
     about in the next chapter.

Note: By default, all members of a class are private if you
      don't specify an access specifier: */

class MyClass2
{
    int x; // Private attribute
    int y; // Private attribute
};
