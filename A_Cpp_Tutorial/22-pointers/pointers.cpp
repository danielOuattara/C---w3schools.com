   /*
   You learned from the previous chapter, that we can get
   the memory address of a variable by using the "&"
   operator */

   /* A pointer however, is a variable that stores the memory
      address as its value.

      A pointer variable points to a data type (like int or string)
      of the same type, and is created with the * operator.
      The address of the variable you're working with is assigned
      to the pointer:

   string *pointer_food = &food;
   cout << "pointer_food = " << pointer_food << endl; // 0x61fdd0

   int salary = 35000;
   cout << "salary = " << salary << endl;   // 35000
   cout << "&salary = " << &salary << endl; //

   int *salary_pointer = &salary;
   cout << "salary_pointer = " << salary_pointer << endl;

   /* NOTE:
      string* pointer_food; //    <-- Preferred
      string *pointer_food;
      string * pointer_food;
      */
