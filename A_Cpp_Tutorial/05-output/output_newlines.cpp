C++ New Lines:
===============

To insert a new line, you can use the "\n" character:
Two "\n" characters after each other will create a blank line:

Another way to insert a new line, is with the "endl" manipulator:

NOTE: Both "\n" and "endl" are used to break lines.
     However, "\n" is used more often and is the preferred way.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello World! \n";
    cout << "I'am learning C++ again \n\n";
    cout << "What about you ?" << endl;
    return 0;
}
