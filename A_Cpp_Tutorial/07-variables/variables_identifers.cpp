  /* C++ Identifiers
  ===================

  All C++ variables must be identified with unique names.
  These unique names are called identifiers.
  Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more
  descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

  Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order
  to create understandable and maintainable code: */

  // Good
  int minutesPerHour = 60;

  // OK, but not so easy to understand what m actually is
  int m = 60;

  /*The general rules for naming variables are:

     Names can contain letters, digits and underscores
     Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_)
     Names are case sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables)
     Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.
     Reserved words (like C++ keywords, such as int) cannot be used as names
